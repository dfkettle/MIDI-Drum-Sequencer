# MIDI Drum Sequencer

The MIDI Drum Sequencer (MDS) is designed to emulate hardware drum machines, allowing you to create and edit drum sequences (patterns) and combine them into entire songs. Patterns can be up to 32 steps long (longer patterns can be created by running two or more patterns in sequence). Patterns can be combined to run sequentially and/or in parallel, with virtually no limitation on the number of patterns involved or the complexity of their organization. Up to 8 instruments can be selected for each pattern, but if you need more than 8, you can have two patterns run concurrently (in parallel).
